**Sky24** is a web portal developed for the Astronomy Quiz SKY24, organized by the Isipathana College Astronomical Society. It allows users to register, check the event status, and view results. Administrators have access to a dashboard to manage user information, update event details, change site settings, dynamically update the database, and perform various other tasks.

# Technologies Used
[![Firebase](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firebase-DD2C00?style=for-the-badge&logo=Firebase&logoColor=black&labelColor=DD2C00&color=FFC400)](https://console.firebase.google.com)
[![Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next.js-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=Next.js&logoColor=white)](https://nextjs.org)

# Preview
Since the event has concluded, we deleted the Firebase project, and the site is no longer accessible through the default URL. Instead, you can visit https://mrbhanukab.github.io/sky24/ to view an archived preview of the site. You can explore all actions freely, but note that nothing will function on the backend since it is no longer active. While some features may not work due to the lack of backend access, 99% of the siteâ€™s functionality remains intact. Feel free to give it a try!
## Home
This is the homepage, accessible at https://mrbhanukab.github.io/sky24/.

By default, the event info displays 'FINAL ROUND RESULT ...'. It was supposed to fetch the current status from the database and display it dynamically. However, you can try changing the event and explore all options by pressing the event indicator.
